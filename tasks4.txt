1.
Let’s start by checking out the whole transactions table:
SELECT *
FROM transactions;
What are the column names?

2.
The money_in column records the amount (in USD) the user bought.
What is the total money_in in the table?

3.
The money_out column records the amount (in USD) the user sold.
What is the total money_out in the table?

4.
It was reported that Bitcoin dominates Fiddy Cent’s exchange. Let’s see if it is true within these dates by answering two questions:
•	How many money_in transactions are in this table?
•	How many money_in transactions are in this table where ‘BIT’ is the currency?

5.
What was the largest transaction in this whole table?
Was it money_in or money_out?

6.
What is the average money_in in the table for the currency Ethereum (‘ETH’)?

7.
Let’s build a ledger for the different dates.
Select date, average money_in, and average money_out from the table.
And group everything by date.

8.
To make the previous query easier to read, round the averages to 2 decimal places.
Give the column aliases using AS for readability.
