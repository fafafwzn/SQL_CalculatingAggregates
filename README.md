# SQL_CalculatingAggregates

This repo is intended to represent my SQL skill using projects provided by Codecademy. All the projects is from the "Calculating Aggregates" course.

## Project 1: Trend in Startups
Howdy! It’s your first day as a TechCrunch reporter. Your first task is to write an article on the rising trends in the startup world.
To get you started with your research, your boss emailed you a project.sqlite file that contains a table called startups. It is a portfolio of some of the biggest names in the industry.
Write queries with aggregate functions to retrieve some interesting insights about these companies.
The preview of the table is as below.

## Project 2: The Metropolitan Museum of Art
The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York is one of the world’s largest and finest art museums.
In this project, you will be working with a table named met that contains the museum’s collection of American Decorative Arts.
It has the following columns:
•	id - the id of the art piece
•	department - the department of the art piece
•	category - the category of the art piece
•	title - the title name of the art piece
•	artist - the name of the artist
•	date - the date(s) of the art piece
•	medium - the medium of the art piece
•	country - the country of the artist
This data was kindly made publicly available under the <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/policies-and-documents/image-resources" target="_blank">Open Access Policy</a>.
The preview of the table is as below.
