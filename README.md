# SQL_CalculatingAggregates

This repo is intended to represent my SQL skill using projects provided by Codecademy. All the projects is from the "Calculating Aggregates" course.

## Project 1: Trend in Startups
Howdy! It’s your first day as a TechCrunch reporter. Your first task is to write an article on the rising trends in the startup world.
To get you started with your research, your boss emailed you a project.sqlite file that contains a table called startups. It is a portfolio of some of the biggest names in the industry.
Write queries with aggregate functions to retrieve some interesting insights about these companies.
The preview of the table is as below.
